# 23gate quickstart

23gate watches for Events on a range of EVM blockchains and delivers them as webhooks to your application.

## Quickstart in 3 easy steps

1. Launch `server.mjs` code on your externally accessible server.

2. Create an account on [23gate](https://23gate.com/) and create a webhook listening on contract `0x55d398326f99059fF775485246999027B3197955` (USDT) on <b>BNB Chain</b> for the `Approval` event and type in the proper <b>Endpoint URL</b> of your just launched server.

3. In a few seconds you will see incoming webhook notifications of the USDT approvals as they are happenning on BNB Chain.

> Please note that while we are in the prelaunch stage only the first dozen webhooks are delivered and then the webhook is disabled. [Please get in touch with us](https://t.me/two_three_gate) to have that restriction lifted from your account.
